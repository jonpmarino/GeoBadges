                Bunch of filler text, like the kind of filler you put in tacos. Limes and cilantro, slow-cooked pork and onions. With a double corn tortilla. It will taste so good. Cilantro tastes like soap to some people and apparently that's a genetic factor. But that's enough for now, because I am listening to Belle & Sebastian, which is a band from Scotland. Scotch whisky is also from Scotland, so you know they must be good. Although Japanese whisky has possibly gotten better than Scotch. The Yamazaki single malts sherry cask 2013 year was named the best scotch of the year.
